# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "1s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 10000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
  ## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
  ## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
  # collection_offset = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "1s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
  ## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  ##
  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ##
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
  precision = "0ns"

  ## Log at debug level.
  debug = false
  ## Log only error level messages.
  # quiet = false

  ## Log target controls the destination for logs and can be one of "file",
  ## "stderr" or, on Windows, "eventlog".  When set to "file", the output file
  ## is determined by the "logfile" setting.
  # logtarget = "file"

  ## Name of the file to be logged to when using the "file" logtarget.  If set to
  ## the empty string then logs are written to stderr.
  # logfile = "myLogFile"

  ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
  ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
  # logfile_rotation_interval = "0h"

  ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
  ## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

  ## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
  ## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

  ## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
  ## Example: America/Chicago
  # log_with_timezone = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = "influxdb"
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
  omit_hostname = true

  ## Method of translating SNMP objects. Can be "netsnmp" (deprecated) which
  ## translates by calling external programs snmptranslate and snmptable,
  ## or "gosmi" which translates using the built-in gosmi library.
  # snmp_translator = "netsnmp"

  ## Name of the file to load the state of plugins from and store the state to.
  ## If uncommented and not empty, this file will be used to save the state of
  ## stateful plugins on termination of Telegraf. If the file exists on start,
  ## the state in the file will be restored for the plugins.
  # statefile = ""

  ## Change the file mode bits on unix sockets.  These permissions may not be
  ## respected by some platforms, to safely restrict write permissions it is best
  ## to place the socket into a directory that has previously been created
  ## with the desired permissions.

  ## Maximum number of concurrent connections.
  ## Only applies to stream sockets (e.g. TCP).

  ## Maximum socket buffer size (in bytes when no unit specified).
  ## For stream sockets, once the buffer fills up, the sender will start backing up.
  ## For datagram sockets, once the buffer fills up, metrics will start dropping.
  ## Defaults to the OS default.

  ## Message splitting strategy and corresponding settings for stream sockets
  ## (tcp, tcp4, tcp6, unix or unixpacket). The setting is ignored for packet
  ## listeners such as udp.
  ## Available strategies are:

  ##   delimiter       -- split at delimiter byte-sequence in hex-format

  ##   variable length -- split depending on length information received in the
  ##                      data. The length field information is specified in
  ##                      `splitting_length_field`.

  ## Delimiter used to split received data to messages consumed by the parser.
  ## The delimiter is a hex byte-sequence marking the end of a message
  ## e.g. "0x0D0A", "x0d0a" or "0d0a" marks a Windows line-break (CR LF).
  ## The value is case-insensitive and can be specifed with "0x" or "x" prefix
  ## or withou.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "delimiter".

  ## Fixed length of a message in bytes.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "fixed length".

  ## Specification of the length field contained in the data to split messages
  ## with variable length. The specification contains the following fields:
  ##  offset        -- start of length field in bytes from begin of data
  ##  bytes         -- length of length field in bytes
  ##  endianness    -- endianness of the value, either "be" for big endian or
  ##                   "le" for little endian
  ##  header_length -- total length of header to be skipped when passing
  ##                   data on to the parser. If zero (default), the header
  ##                   is passed on to the parser together with the message.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "variable length".
  # splitting_length_field = {offset = 0, bytes = 0, endianness = "be", header_length = 0}
